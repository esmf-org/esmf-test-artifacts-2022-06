Warning: Process to core binding is enabled and OMP_NUM_THREADS is set to non-zero (1) value
If your program has OpenMP sections, this can cause over-subscription of cores and consequently poor performance
To avoid this, please re-run your application after setting MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY=0
Use MV2_USE_THREAD_WARNING=0 to suppress this message
